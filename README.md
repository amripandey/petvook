## Idea 
 The idea behind the existence of this website is all those street dogs in kathmandu.They are nor cared nor loved or feed, but it is also not a people in kathmandu are mercyless, but they want to help and there is question is How ? During my education in kathmandu valley I see a lot of dog in every street having a gang of them caring and protecting there street.But for that dogs have to pay huge price they are covered with cut and bruises ,there ribs and bones can be seen imprinted clearly through skins. So I want to make sure that dogs can have better life. This website is not only a api of street every dogs in kathmandu valley as well as in your places also as my site document the place name automatically and make it available in every one notification who lives in your neighour who want to help.
